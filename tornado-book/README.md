This directory contains all the scripts, examples which I wrote while learning with [OReilly Tornado book](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Tornado-Michael-Dory/dp/1449309070/)

Most of the codebase is a fork from original Github [repo](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Tornado/Introduction-to-Tornado) by the author of book itself.
